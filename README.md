# SMART-SAP-Integrator
SMART SAP Integrator

In this project, was developed an integration tool responsible for extracting accounting balances and tax data from SAP and sending it to a Brazilian accounting and fiscal reporting management tool. 

We used ABAP to encode, Talend Data Integration and Java to build ETL tier and T-SQL / Oracle PL SQL for data persistence at the final destination. This product is commercialized today and ten customers are using it in less than two years on the market.
